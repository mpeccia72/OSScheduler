NOTE TO GRADER:
I want to start by saying that I know I'm not getting a high score, the program output doesn't work.
However, there still is a lot done right in the code that I can get partial credit for. The code is well
organized and commented so everything should be easy to find. After talking to various classmates who 
also are confused and have no faith in their program, I just got to submit and hope you're leniant, I have other classes I need to work on right now so I must abandon the ship. Rip.

Errors To Know
- Lists aren't sorted by arrival time
- The FCFS disk portion isn't built out, I only finished the CPU and got squeezed on time
- Didn't know what to do with terminals
